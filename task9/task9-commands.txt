TASK9 — COMMANDS:

asciinema rec basic-revert.cast

source setup.sh

git log --decorate --oneline

cat greeting.txt

git revert c9e62bb

git log --decorate --oneline
→ the revert command added a new commit, rather than removing the original commit.

cat greeting.txt → original contents restored.

ls → we need to find the commit corresponding to the credentials.txt file.

git log --decorate --oneline → it is commit "41920b1".

git revert 41920b1

git log --decorate --oneline

ls
→ How many commits were added or changed by the last revert? 1 commit was added to delete the credentials.txt file, but it is still being created in the initial commit number 41920b1.

git show 41920b1 → file still in history.

As you have now reverted the credentials file, so it is removed from your working directory, is it also removed from git? No, ref pointers are not moved to a state before the 41920b1 commit, but rather they are moved to a new state after the inverse-41920b1 commit introduced by revert.
