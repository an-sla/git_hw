TASK8 — COMMANDS:

asciinema rec rebase-branch.cast

source setup.sh

git branch

git log --oneline --graph --all

git checkout uppercase

git log --oneline --graph --all
→ How does the log compare? — HEAD is at uppercase in the second instance, two separate branches shown.

git rebase main

git log --oneline --graph --all
→ What did just happen? — feature blobs placed after main blobs on main branch, one branch shown.

cat greeting.txt → showing changes from the last blob which has been rebased on the uppercase branch only ("rebase is used on the feature branch whereas merge is performed of the main branch" → thus, while on feature, our HEAD is at "HELLO", uppercase).

git checkout main

git log --oneline --graph --all → HEAD in different place that when showing log from uppercase.

cat greeting.txt → while on main after a rebase but before a merge, our HEAD is at previous state of "hello" (lowercase).

git merge uppercase → merges HELLO (uppercase) into main without explicitly creating a merge commit, main HEAD is updated to HELLO (shown by next step).

cat greeting.txt

git log --oneline --graph --all → Now shows HEAD -> main, uppercase because the last blob has been connected with both main and uppercase.

git branch -d uppercase

git branch

exit
