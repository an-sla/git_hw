# git_hw
Git practice repo based on the [git-katas](https://github.com/eficode-academy/git-katas) project; created for HSE Y1 course.


\* setup.sh wasn't run for the first two exercises ಠ╭╮ಠ, but they are complete

\* DS_Store was added to .gitignore after the first two exercises through [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/lohenyumnam/2b127b9c3d1435dc12a33613c44e6308)

\* task 18 could not be completed because of remote repo conflicts between this repo on github and a 'remote' repo in the exercise
