# git_hw
Git practice repo based on the [git-katas](https://github.com/eficode-academy/git-katas) project; created for HSE Y1 course.


\* setup.sh wasn't run for the first two exercises ಠ╭╮ಠ, but they are complete

\* DS_Store was added to .gitignore after the first two exercises through [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/lohenyumnam/2b127b9c3d1435dc12a33613c44e6308)

\* tasks 15, 16 could not be recorded through asciinema because stashing breaks the recording!

\* task 18 could not be completed because of remote repo conflicts between this repo on github and a 'remote' repo in the exercise

\* task 22, 25–32 were not completed
