git branch

git branch feature/uppercase

git checkout feature/uppercase

git status → "on branch feature/uppercase", same files as in main because we created our new branch based on main (its state and the files it was pointing to is reflected in feature/uppercase).

nano greeting.txt:
"HELLO WORLD"
save file and exit

git add greeting.txt

git commit -m "all-caps greeting" greeting.txt

git branch → feature/uppercase shown first because it is ahead of main ("By default, the branches and their commits are shown in reverse chronological order." — based on git documentation).

git log --oneline --graph --all → feature/uppercase is shown as HEAD

git checkout main

cat greeting.txt → lowercase "hello".

git diff main..feature/uppercase

git merge feature/uppercase

cat greeting.txt → implemented uppercase through git merge.

git branch -d feature/uppercase

git branch → no more feature/uppercase.

exit
