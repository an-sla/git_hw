TASK3 — COMMANDS:

source setup.sh

asciinema rec basic-branching.cast

git branch → on "master"

git branch mybranch

git branch → 3 branches in total: master, second-branch, mybranch.

git checkout mybranch

git status

git checkout main

git status → no changes on either branch, they are the same, but the first line of git status changes to indicate current branch.

ls on master
ls on mybranch 
→ contains the same files, because mybranch was created on the basis of master and no changes have been made to either (they are in the same state).

echo "Anastasia" > file1.txt → in mybranch.

git add file1.txt

git commit -m "my_name file1" file1.txt

git log --oneline --graph

git checkout main

git log --oneline --graph → file1 commit missing.

echo "Alexa" > file2.txt → in master.

git add file2.txt

git commit -m "alexa-name file2" file2.txt

git log --oneline --graph --all

git checkout mybranch

ls → cannot see file2.txt.

git diff mybranch main

exit
